I'm Oriel Sanchez, a Math-CS student at UC San Diego.
I'm passionate about software engineering and have a particular interest in Rust and system-level programming.
Iâ€™ve worked on optimizing software tools, developing custom solutions, and contributing to both academic and personal projects that push my coding skills further.

Outside of tech, I enjoy running, hiking, jiu-jitsu, skateboarding, and chess. I'm always up for a challenge, whether it's in the form of code or outdoor adventures. You can learn more about my work on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/orielsanchez) or [GitHub](https://github.com/orielsanchez).
